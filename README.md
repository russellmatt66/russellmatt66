Hi, I'm Matt! 

Currently, I am a graduate student at the University of Washington where I study computational plasma physics in the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics.
My background is in Physics and Electrical Engineering, but my passion has always been for computing. It's what drives my studies and I find the subject endlessly
fascinating. However, I like to keep my feet grounded (the electrical engineer in me speaking), and between algorithms, data structures, and operating systems 
it's easy to become disconnected from what matters: solving problems like climate change, global inequality, and resource scarcity.

My firm belief is that we can address these kinds of large-scale issues with the right technology. For example, with the right technology, i.e., a break-even 
fusion reactor, the climate crisis becomes tractable. Other serious problems, like the water shortages projected to begin occurring by 2050, also have similar
problems. Current desalination technology is woefully inadequate: bulky, complicated, and requiring specialized membranes to perform the filtration.  We need devices that are robust, deployable, and easy to operate for the kind of distributed solution that is needed to work. 

Implementing this is not an easy task, but I think what we are looking for is a reactor that works using plasmachemical processes. These are chemical processes that occur in a plasma medium and therefore are much more expansive in range. Fundamentally, the reason for this has to do with the proliferation of electrons that one finds in a plasma and that are absent in a liquid or gaseous reactor. Compared to the other species of particle one finds in a plasma: positive ions, negative ions, and neutrals, electrons are substantially lighter and therefore move much faster on average. This relatively high speed means the electrons carry a substantial amount of kinetic energy with their random motion and new avenues of chemical reaction involving highly-excited or ionized species become possible as a result of electron-impact processes. 

In general, the behavior of this kind of system is highly nonlinear and analytical solutions are sparse, based on limiting assumptions, and only applicable to specific situations. Numerical simulation using modern processors and techniques like parallelization is the most promising method of attack, but the very large number of particles in these ensembles means that cleverness and craftiness is still necessary.
