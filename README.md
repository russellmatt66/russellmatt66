Hi, I'm Matt! 

Currently, I am a graduate student at the University of Washington where I study computational plasma physics and high performance computing. I am also part of a project that researchers the M2P2 propulsion concept, and work as a TA in the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics during the academic year. My background is in Quantum Physics and Electrical Engineering, but my passion has always been for computing, and the science of computers. 

I have a working familiarity with the C, C++, Fortran, and Python programming languages and a strong desire to work more with these languages. Becoming a better programmer is important to me, and in my spare time I read and work through various books on computer science in pursuit of this goal.   

I have a lot of technical knowledge pertaining to physics, mathematics, and engineering, but above all I am a quick study who is motivated by the prospect of writing good, clean, readable code that is communicable to others! My background and attitude make me a great fit for a junior software engineering role where I can make compact, coherent, working contributions while strengthening my CS basics.
