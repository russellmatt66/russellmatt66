Hi there, I'm Matt! Welcome to my Github. Please allow me to briefly introduce myself, and give my background.

I have a Master's degree in Aeronautics & Astronautics from the University of Washington where I studied parallel programming, computational plasma physics, nuclear fusion, and high-performance computing, and an undergraduate degree in Physics from Santa Clara University, where I studied electromagnetics, electrical engineering, and quantum computing. 

HPC is a field that I came to somewhat late. After an undergraduate class in C, and one in ARM assembly, I spent most of the next few years either not programming, or writing Matlab. Matlab is easily my least favorite programming language, the only one that I truly dislike, but the one thing that I will not begrudge it is that it is good for teaching beginners who are running Windows. I was deeply dissatisfied during this period, for reasons that I could not articulate at the time, but which I now know stemmed from the amount of Matlab that I was writing. The language is slow, clunky, and after programming in C, it felt like a step backward. I looked at my peers who were taking data structures in C++ with envy. Every line of Matlab that I wrote felt like a dead-end, a road to nowhere, just another string of characters that produced nothing except a file to be run by the slow, bloated interpreter; each one leading further away from my goal of mastering the discipline of programming. Anyways, I've probably said enough about it.    

My response to these feelings was to throw myself headlong into the pursuit of acquiring as low-level an understanding of computer architecture as I could. I minored in electrical engineering so that I could peel back the layers of a computing machine, and majored in physics so that I could understand how the ensemble actually worked at the lowest-level.

This changed in graduate school, when I wrote parallel code that achieved Teraflops (Tflops = 10^12 Flops) of performance, making it the highest-performing code on the final exam of an entire graduate HPC class of 100+. This moment was an epiphany. Afterwards, I used what I learned about C++, and high-performance computing to write both fluid, and kinetic plasma simulations where I implemented serial kernels which achieve Gigaflops (Gflops = 10^9 Flops) of performance on problem sizes ranging from hundreds of millions of particles, to billions of fluid points.

Now, I'm applying my passion for computing, creativity, and skill at writing parallel, and high-performance, code to
