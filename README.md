Welcome to my Github! I hope you enjoy the various projects, and codes, that I have written.

In this repo, you will find files written in C, C++, Python, Julia, Rust, and bash. 

The projects range from high-performance plasma physics simulations, to explorations of the performance of different execution configurations on a CUDA implementation of binary search.
