Hi there, I'm Matt! 

I have a Master's degree in Aeronautics & Astronautics from the University of Washington where I studied computational plasma physics, nuclear fusion, and high-performance computing, and an undergraduate degree in Physics from Santa Clara University, where I studied electromagnetics and quantum computing. 

Along the way I worked in Silicon Valley, and in graduate school I wrote parallel code that achieved Teraflops (Tflops = 10^12 Flops) of performance, making it the highest-performing code on the final of an entire graduate HPC class of 100+. Afterwards, I used what I learned about C++ and high-performance computing to write both fluid, and kinetic plasma simulations where I implemented serial kernels which achieve Gigaflops (Gflops = 10^9 Flops) of performance on problem sizes ranging from hundreds of millions of particles, to billions of fluid points. 

Writing fast C++ code is my #1 technical skill. I accomplish this via an understanding of and lifelong passion for computer architecture, together with a minimal approach towards coding that supports my ability to write efficient parallel code. The best code, all else being equal, is the one with the least amount of lines. It's still got to be readable, of course. 

GPU programming and writing high-performance code are my interests. To keep my math and physics knowledge sharp, I like to do the odd computational physics project involving electromagnetism and/or plasma physics. I think artificial intelligence is also interesting, particularly its application towards computational physics, e.g., PINNs.
