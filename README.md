Hi, I'm Matt. I have an undergraduate degree in Physics, where I studied electromagnetics and quantum computing, and a Master's degree in engineering from the University of Washington where I studied computational plasma physics, nuclear fusion, and high-performance computing. Along the way I wrote the highest-performing code on the final of my graduate HPC class, which is something that I'm proud of. 

Writing fast C++ code is my #1 technical skill. I accomplish this via an understanding of computer architecture, and a minimal approach towards coding. The best code, all else being equal, is the one with the least amount of lines. It's still got to be readable, of course. 

Fast, clean code, parallel programming, computer architecture, and GPUs are my interests. As a hobby, I like to write kinetic and fluid simulations of a plasma to keep my math and physics knowledge sharp.
