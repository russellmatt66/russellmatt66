Welcome to my Github! I hope you enjoy the various projects, and codes, that I have written.

In this repo, you will find files written in C, C++, Python, Rust, and bash. Julia and assembly are on the way. 

The projects range from high-performance plasma physics simulations, to explorations of the performance of different execution configurations for a CUDA kernel.
