Hi, I'm Matt! 

Currently, I am a graduate student at the University of Washington where I study computational plasma physics and high performance computing. I have a working familiarity with the Java, C/C++, Fortran, and Python programming languages and a strong desire to continue learning. Becoming a better programmer is important to me, and in my spare time I read and work through various books on computer science in pursuit of this goal.   

I have a lot of technical knowledge pertaining to physics, mathematics, and engineering, but above all I am a quick study who is motivated by the prospect of writing good, clean, readable code that is communicable to others!
