Hi there, I'm Matt! 

I have an undergraduate degree in Physics, where I studied electromagnetics and quantum computing, and a Master's degree in Aeronautics & Astronautics from the University of Washington where I studied computational plasma physics, nuclear fusion, and high-performance computing. 

Along the way I worked in Silicon Valley, and wrote code that achieved Teraflops (Tflops = 10^12 Flops) of performance while being the highest-performing code on the final of a entire graduate HPC class of 100+. Afterwards, I used what I learned about C++ and high-performance computing to write both fluid, and kinetic plasma simulations where I implemented serial kernels which achieve Gigaflops (Gflops = 10^9 Flops) of performance on problem sizes ranging from hundreds of millions of particles, to billions of fluid points. 

Writing fast C++ code is my #1 technical skill. I accomplish this via an understanding of and lifelong passion for computer architecture, together with a minimal approach towards coding. The best code, all else being equal, is the one with the least amount of lines. It's still got to be readable, of course. 

Electromagnetics, nuclear fusion, fast, clean code, parallel programming, computer architecture, C, C++, Rust, Julia and GPUs are my tech interests. To keep my math and physics knowledge sharp, I like to do the odd computational physics project. I think artificial intelligence is interesting, particularly its application towards computational physics, e.g., PINNs. Electromagnetics is my favorite field of physics, by far.
