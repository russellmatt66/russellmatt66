Hi, I'm Matt! 

Currently, I am a graduate student at the University of Washington where I study computational plasma physics in the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics. My background is in Physics and Electrical Engineering, but my passion has always been for computing, and the science of computers. Analog electronics, where we analyzed the physics and operation of several different kinds of solid state transistors, was my favorite class as an undergrad because it finally gave me a glimpse into how the lowest level of computers worked. To feed my passion during this time, under the supervision of Dr. Guy Ramon, I also did some research into the field of solid-state quantum computing using Hund-Milliken theory to analyze quantum dots. 

Now, I am part of a project to simulate the M2P2 plasma propulsion concept using the NIMROD MHD code, as well as the TA for the graduate class "AA/ME507: Incompressible Flow". Beyond this, I am working through the book "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures" by Bradley Miller and David Ranum to build my knowledge of, and skill using Python. 

I have a lot of specialized, technical knowledge pertaining to physics, mathematics, and engineering, but above all I am a quick study who is motivated by the prospect of writing good, clean, readable code that is communicable to others! My background and attitude make me a great fit for a junior software engineering role where I can make compact, coherent, working contributions while building my CS basics.
